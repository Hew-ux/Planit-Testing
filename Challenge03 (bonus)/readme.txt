Open the "open me.html" file in your preferred web browser.
To change the arbitrary points, open "open me.html" in your preferred text editor and alter the following lines:
	var point1 = [1,1];
	var point2 = [11,7];
to be whatever number you want within the range.
The default range is 1-20, and can be altered in the "ascii.plotter.js" file.
This is the roughest one as it was made as an extra.
